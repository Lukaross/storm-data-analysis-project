# storm-data-analysis-project

A short EDA project on the NOAA Storm Database in which we were asked to answer two questions.  
1) Across the United States, which types of events are most harmful with respect to population health?
2) Across the United States, which types of events have the greatest economic consequences?
There were constraints on number of figures produced and the format of the report. 
The dataset used is inculded in this repo.
